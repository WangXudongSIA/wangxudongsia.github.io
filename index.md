## About Me

I’m a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems at Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIA) & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://sia.cas.cn/vision/kytd/yjry/202307/t20230726_6834579.html" target="_blank"> Zhi Han</a>. Before UCAS, I received my banchelor’s degree in Jun. 2022 at North University of China. I am a selected participant in the China Association for Science and Technology Young Scientific and Technological Talents Nurturing Program (Specialized Doctoral). 

My research focuses on **Robotic Learning**, **Embodied AI**, and **Computer Vision**.

I also serve as CAA, AAAI Member and the reviewer for several conferences and journals such as ICLR, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ACM MM, AAAI and TIP, TCYB, TNNLS, TII, RAL.
